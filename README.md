#### Fork me
You could practice forking by clicking the fork button, which will grab a copy of the current state of this repo and stick it in your own personal GitHub profile. Then you could clone it and work on it by yourself by experimenting with committs and pushing these up to your own GitHub. This would be a good skill to use for making cloud backups of your work, meaning you could change things from home or OP and merge the changes later.
