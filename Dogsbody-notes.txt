Dosgsbody is a testing account to trial the features of collaborative work in GitHub.

There is no intention for this account to pretend to be a real person or to be used as such.

After pulling lecturer-notes from the remote repo, this addition is testing to see if a merge 
is required with a push or if it will just work because everything is up to date.
